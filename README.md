# Automata

An educational environment for creating and executing finite-state automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. Based on the [MEAN.js](http://www.meanjs.org) boilerplate and the [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) graph library.

A live WIP is on [Heroku](https://tmfsa.herokuapp.com/). Click on "Automata" to see a list of demo automata. To play around with creating your own, select "New Finite State Automaton",  "New Pushdown Automaton", or "New Turing Machine" from the "Create" dropdown menu. Hold your mouse button or touch to bring up the context menu to add states and drag from one state to another to add transitions. Touch or click and hold to delete a state, and click on a state (or double tap) to make a state an acceptance state (for FSAs).

# Automata

An educational environment for creating and executing finite-state automata and Turing machines. Based on the [MEAN.js](http://www.meanjs.org) boilerplate and the [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) graph library.

A live demo (very much WIP) is on [Heroku](https://powerful-dusk-34012.herokuapp.com/).
